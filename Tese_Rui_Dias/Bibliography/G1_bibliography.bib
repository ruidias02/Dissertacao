	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of ﬁve projects funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation under its Future Internet Architecture Program. NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson ﬁrst publicly presented in 2006.1 The NDN project investigates Jacobson’s proposed evolution from today’s host-centric network architecture (IP) to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). This conceptually simple shift has far-reaching implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications. We describe the motivation and vision of this new architecture, and its basic components and operations. We also provide a snapshot of its current design, development status, and research challenges. More information about the project, including prototype implementations, publications, and annual reports, is available on named-data.net.},

	abstract = {Previous literatures articulated that the NDN architecture may possess unique advantages in supporting battleﬁeld communications [1], and that NDN can provide superior performance over TCP/IP under various scenarios, in particular in supporting multiparty distributed applications [2] by using a novel dataset synchronization protocol. In this paper we ﬁrst describe the designs of dataset synchronization protocols (Sync in short), in particular ChronoSync and PSync, that run over NDN to support multiparty applications, and summarize the lessons from their designs. We then perform a preliminary suitability assessment of the existing Sync protocols in ad hoc mobile environments with intermitted connectivity. Our assessment suggests that Sync protocols based on state vectors can operate most resiliently under highly dynamic conditions, and identiﬁes remaining issues for further investigation.},

	abstract = {This report provides a brief introduction to State Vector Sync (SVS), a sync protocol for Named Data Networking (NDN). To support distributed applications, sync protocols synchronize the data names of a shared dataset among a group of participants. In this report, we explain how the SVS design is influenced by the lessons that have been cumulated over previous sync protocol designs and describe the protocol and its functions to allow experimentation with the SVS library implementations.},
